useRef
    ref is passed as a prop to the component we want to use useRef to get the data from( (1) let's say we passed a ref prop to the input componenet ). This is useful for cases where you want to measure the DOM node of a component that you are using the hook from.
    like an input field.

    // In our project we can use the useRef when we add + and - to the cart icon. We can use the useRef to get the current value of the input field and then add or subtract from it.
    
    And later on the component we have passed the ref to ( (2) in the input componenet) we wrap the component function with React.fordward ref and pass ref as the second parameter alongside props if there is one ( (3) 
        const Input = React.forwardRef ((props, ref) => {
            // where we want to get the data from we set the ref prop as ref(the parameter)
         <input ref={ref} />
        });
    )
